# Genfolio

Genfolio is a no-code platform for generating developer resume pages.

## Our stack
- We use a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) frontend to create a responsive and speedy server-side rendered (SSR) website.
- The frontend interfaces with an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) API on the backend to handle requests in an optimal manner.
- The [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/developers) is queried to provide accurate information on a developer's achievements and contributions.

This is a group submission for [TechOptimum](https://techoptimum.devpost.com/) by [David Chen](https://github.com/TheEgghead27), [Leonid Metlitsky](https://github.com/leomet07), [John Murphy](https://github.com/jmurphy5613), and [Richard Watkins](https://github.com/thegu5).
