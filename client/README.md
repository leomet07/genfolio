# Svelte app

This is a project template for my [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/leomet07/svelte-template.

Create a new project based off this template with my cli tool, [svelte-gen](https://github.com/leomet07/sveltegen).

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies`.
