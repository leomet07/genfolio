# Genfolio Client

This is the Genfolio client, based on [Leonid's project template](https://github.com/leomet07/svelte-template) for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start the Genfolio client (development) server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies`.

## Deploy Script
Alternatively, you could use the `redeploy.sh` script at the root of this repository, which handles installation and setup with an optimized production build.
